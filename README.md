Welcome to my first serious React project! For this one I mainly used ReactJS. Other technologies I used were:

  1. WebRTC
  2. Socket.io
  3. Nodemon
  4. Express
  5. Material UI 

I published the Frontend part on Netlify and you can check it out here: https://video-call-appio.netlify.app/. The Backend part was published on Heroku.
The app is very easy to use. Just allow the browser to use your mic and camera. Than you can simply copy your id that changes every time you visit the website and send it to someone who wants to call you. I will be implementing new features in the future (mute, toggle video, resize video window, etc.)
